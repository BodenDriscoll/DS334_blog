    "text": "I am working with an NFL data set that gives information regarding offensive players in the NFL. I am looking into specifically the New England Patriots. Exploring their leading receiving positions along with their specific leading receivers. Following that, I also looked into passing yard leaders for the entire NFL, based on average passing yards per game. In the quarterback data set there is 43 observations, only 3 in the first NE data set and 10 observations for total receivers for the patriots receivers. My question of interest is what position has the most receivers yards for the patriots, following that, what players have the most receiving yards. Then what quarterbacks throw for the most yards per game, is there anything that stands out. The data came from an online source that gave me the R package. It is just an R package that can be installed (library(nflreadr). This data is from the 2025 NFL season and contains all Patriot games, including the postseason.\n\nlibrary(nflreadr)\n\nWarning: package 'nflreadr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\noffensive_stats &lt;- nflreadr::load_player_stats(2025)\n\n\npats_receiving &lt;- offensive_stats |&gt;\n  filter(team == \"NE\") |&gt;\n  filter(position %in% c(\"WR\",\"TE\",\"RB\")) |&gt;\n   group_by(position) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_yards = mean(receiving_yards),\n              se = sd(receiving_yards) / sqrt(n())) |&gt;\n  mutate(se_lb = avg_yards - se,\n         se_ub = avg_yards + se) |&gt;\n  mutate(position = fct_reorder(position, avg_yards))\n\nggplot(data = pats_receiving, aes(x = position, y = avg_yards)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = se_lb, ymax = se_ub)) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Average Yards\",\n       title = \"Average Yards per game by position for the New England Patriots\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data displays the average receiving yards per game by each position on the New England Patriots. It is clear that receivers had the most average yards per game, however, the tight ends were far closer than expected. This is probably one of the closest differences between tight ends and receivers in the NFL.\n\npats_receiving_players &lt;- offensive_stats |&gt;\n  filter(team == \"NE\") |&gt;\n   filter(position %in% c(\"WR\",\"TE\",\"RB\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n    summarise(avg_yards = mean(receiving_yards),\n              se = sd(receiving_yards) / sqrt(n())) |&gt;\n  filter(avg_yards &gt;= 5) |&gt;\n  mutate(se_lb = avg_yards - se,\n         se_ub = avg_yards + se) |&gt;\n  mutate(position = fct_reorder(player_display_name, avg_yards))\n\nggplot(data = pats_receiving_players, aes(x = player_display_name, y = avg_yards)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = se_lb, ymax = se_ub)) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Average Yards\",\n       y = \"Player Name\",\n       title = \"Average Yards per game by each Patriots player who catches passes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStefon Diggs led the team in average yards per game, however it is a very even spread for the New England Patriots with no one player being overly better and leading the team by a lot. The widest standard error is also Stefon Diggs meaning he had the widest range of receiving yards. A possibility of having one or two games that may have skewed his average yards to be higher.\n\nQB_info &lt;- offensive_stats |&gt;\n  filter(position == \"QB\") |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_yards = mean(passing_yards),\n              se = sd(passing_yards) / sqrt(n())) |&gt;\n  mutate(se_lb = avg_yards - se,\n         se_ub = avg_yards + se) |&gt;\n  filter(avg_yards &gt;= 150) |&gt;\n  mutate(player_display_name = fct_reorder(player_display_name, avg_yards))\n\nggplot(data = QB_info, aes(x = player_display_name, y = avg_yards)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = se_lb, ymax = se_ub)) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Average Yards\", \n       y = \"Player Name\",\n       title = \"Average Yards per Game by Quarterbacks in the NFL 2025 season\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph, there is 43 different quarterbacks that all averaged over 150 yards per game in the past NFL season (2025). A few things that stand out to me is obviously the top player was Matthew Stafford, who ultimately won the MVP this year. Something that is very interesting is Jameis Winston, he has a massive standard error. This is most likely a combination of not playing a large amount of games this past season, along with him most likely having a few games with a lot of yards and a few games with a lot fewer. Other than that there is not a lot standing out, other than the fact that there are still 43 quarterbacks in this data set. Meaning some of these quarterbacks have not played a lot of games this past year as there is only 32 NFL teams.\nThere are a few flaws in the data set. In the first graph, it has displayed the average yards per game by each position, which is what I asked and does give a decent display. A better display would be to find the average yards for each player, then group them by position and for the graph to give a total yards per game of each position. The second graph overall is good and displayed exactly what I wanted. The third graph has a few things I would wish to change, firstly, there are still to many quarterbacks (43), as there are only 32 NFL teams total. It would be a better idea to filter this by each teams main starter, meaning the quarterback who played the most games for each team this year. Secondly, the standard error bars show this some, but somehow displaying how many games each player played would be good to know to understand if their passing yards are actually a good representation.\nIf i had more time I would definitely dive further into the quarterback data, making a more clear graphic and possibly making it possible to see where each player plays. It is a bit jumbled and there are some quarterbacks that may appear pretty good but their sample size is just really small.\nThe standard error bars gave a better representation of the data. Making it easy to examine certain elements where certain players maybe should not be where they are. Each of these graphs display something different, while also conveying information in a simple way that any person can understand. It shows certain things that a table or easy image cannot. Such as Jameis Winston and how is standard error bars are so massive compared to the majority of the data."

    "text": "I am looking at a data set involving the St. Lawrence baseball team. It has data stemming from 2024 for both pitchers and hitters. There are two separate datasets, one for hitters and pitchers, total there are 30 observations. I am looking to see how players who play more games produce compared to those who don’t play as much. Are there certain players who aren’t playing as much and are overachieving? The variables I am most interested in are on base percentage, average, era, and total games played specifically. The data came directly from the St Lawrence website and was put into a table format. Some important things to note are that I scraped the data to remove certain people who may have played an extremely small amount of games. This is to ensure accurate data of people who played at least a decent amount of games in the 2024 season. link: https://saintsathletics.com/sports/baseball/stats/2024\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://saintsathletics.com/sports/baseball/stats/2024\"\n\nslu &lt;- read_html(url)\ntable &lt;- slu %&gt;% html_nodes(\"table\")\n\nobject &lt;- table %&gt;% html_table()\n\nbatting &lt;- object[[1]]\n\npitching &lt;- object[[2]]\n\n\nslu_batting &lt;- batting |&gt;\n   separate_wider_delim(cols = `GP-GS`,\n                       names = c(\"GP\", \"GS\"),\n                       delim = \"-\") |&gt;\n  separate_wider_delim(cols = Player,\n                       names = c(\"Name\",\n                                 \"player\"),\n                       delim = \",\",\n                       too_few = \"align_start\",\n                       too_many = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  slice(1:18) |&gt;\n  filter(AVG != .250)\n\n\nslu_pitching &lt;- pitching |&gt;\n  separate_wider_delim(cols = `APP-GS`,\n                       names = c(\"APP\", \"GS\"),\n                       delim = \"-\") |&gt;\n  separate_wider_delim(cols = Player,\n                       names = c(\"Name\",\n                                 \"player\"),\n                       delim = \",\",\n                       too_few = \"align_start\",\n                       too_many = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  slice(1:16) |&gt;\n  filter(ERA &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  arrange(ERA)\n\n\nggplot(slu_batting, aes(x = `OB%`, y = GP)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Comparing Games Played to On Base Percentage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the graph, as games played goes up, typically on base percentage is higher. This makes sense as the people who play more games are typically the best players and should have higher on base percentages. There is one clear outlier with an on base percentage around 0.46 and only 10 games played. That person would be somebody that should probably be playing more.\n\ntop11_bat &lt;- slu_batting |&gt; \n  slice(1:11)\nggplot(top11_bat, aes(x = Name, y = `OB%`, fill = AVG)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Hitters On Base Percentage Compared to their Average\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data is displaying the top 10 averages on the St. Lawrence baseball team from 2024. On the bottom, displaying the names of the players with the y-axis displaying the on base percentage. The fill color showing the players average based on the scale. This graph indicates players who one, have a high on base percentage while also having a high average. Indicating a very good bat to ball player. While also displaying people who may have a high on base percentage but a very low average. For example, Connor has the best on base percentage while also have an average around 0.35. However, Morrisey has an impressive on base percentage just below while having a higher average than Connor. On the other end, Donnellan has an on base percentage in the top 10, however a significantly lower average around 0.20. This graph indicates players specifically and can compare them easily based on on base percentage.\n\nggplot(slu_pitching, aes(x = IP, y = ERA)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"brown4\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Innings Pitched versus On Base Percentage in Pitchers\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying inning pitched compared to ERA clearly shows a downward trend, as innings pitched increases, ERA decreases. This makes sense as the more innings your coach trusts you to pitch, typically means you are a better pitcher. There is a certain player with the lowest ERA who has only thrown about 22 innings, that player should probably get more innings as they had the lowest ERA in this graph.\n\ntop10_pitch &lt;- slu_pitching |&gt;\n  slice(1:10)\nggplot(top10_pitch, aes(x = Name, y = H, fill = SO)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  labs(y = \"Hits\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Comparing the Number of Hits allowed with Strikeout Totals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph displays the top 10 pitchers based on ERA for the St Lawrence baseball team. Showing the number of hits they allowed with the fill being the number of strikeouts they have had. Obviously, having a low number of hits while also having a high number of strikeouts is the most beneficial. In the graph, Hutchins has some of the most hits, however, clearly has the most strikeouts at the same time. Compared to O’neil who has noticeably lower strikeouts than Hutchins but with the same number of hits. In this graph, nobody noticeably stands out as much as Hutchins who has a massive amount of strikeouts compared to the rest of the players.\nSome flaws from my data could be that from graph to graph it is sometime difficult to determine some key factors. In the hitters graphs, on base percentage and games played clearly have correlation. However, somebody with a lower on base percentage may be essential to have in the field because of their defense, but that is impossible to display with the information I have. In the pitchers data, specifically the bar chart it is easy to see hits and strikeouts and that is something interesting to compare. However, it does not display anything about innings pitched or batters faced. Meaning Hutchins could have just faced far more hitters than the other pitchers but looks worse do to having way more hits allowed which is exactly what has happened here.\nIf I had more time, I would have liked to look into the players that seem to be out performing. The players that don’t have a lot of games but are performing well. I would like to see what grade they are and if there is trend in that. Are players who are performing well but not getting the playing time typically underclassmen?\nMy visualizations have connected ideas from class by displaying information in these bar charts. The line plots do not relate as well because they are more basic but they carry important information that is used in the next plot. The maps allow people to directly compare players and see who is, one, performing better than the rest. And secondly, and I would argue more important, what players are performing well that are not playing as much. This is piece where it may be difficult to see in a coaches view, but when looking at the information, it is easy to see how some people are out performing their peers. This is the essential idea of visualization. Displaying information to people to make certain ideas more clear to the human mind. These graphs allow you to see outliers of people who may be performing well and should play more. Or other people who are playing significantly but aren’t performing."
